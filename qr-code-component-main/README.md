## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fairly basic site to make. The layout was simple, but i was able to make use of Josh Comeau css reset. This provided me with an excellent starting point for my css, but it also helped ensure that the page would display consistently between browsers.

### Continued development

Development on this particular project would be rather limited as it would only be used as a smaller article within a larger website.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This provided me with the CSS reset that i used.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Recommended the Josh Comeau reset, but also provides many videos on CSS styles.
